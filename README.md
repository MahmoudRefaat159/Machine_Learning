# Machine_Learning
This code trains a Random Forest model to predict BMW prices. It loads data, encodes text categories into numbers, removes outliers, splits data into train/test sets (80/20), trains the model, then predicts prices for new cars. Results save to Excel with accuracy scores. Ensures consistent preprocessing for reliable predictions.
